**‚ùó WARNING:**
- Backup your Stock partitions first and copy them to a safe place in case you need them for later recovery.
- Do not modify your Stock partition backup images, especially the boot partition image, or else rolling back to the Stock profile may brick your camera.

### üìñ Overview

### üõ†Ô∏è Guide

**Step 1:** [Setup](README_setup.md)

**Step 2:** Edit `general.conf` with:
```
backup_partitions="yes"
restore_partitions="no"
```

**Step 3:** Insert your SD card into your camera and power on.

**Step 4:** Wait for the camera to restart after the backup operation is finished.

**Step 5:** Check your SD card for backup directory:

- For Stock: `wz_flash-helper/backup/stock` and `Wyze_factory_backup`
- For OpenIPC: `wz_flash-helper/backup/openipc`
- For wzmini: `wz_flash-helper/backup/wzmini`

Under those directories, there are directories with 4-digit ID names where partition backup images are stored.

To know what backup ID was used for the most recent backup, check the `initramfs_serial.log` file.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes
- Backup operation will automatically generate .sha256sum files for partition backup images.
- During the backup operation, the blue LED would be blinking every second.
- Typically backup operation takes about 30 seconds(for reference, it takes 25 seconds on Wyze Cam v3).
