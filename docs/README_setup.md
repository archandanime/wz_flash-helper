**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
- Make sure that your SD card partition table is **MBR** and partition format is **FAT**.
- If your camera is Wyze Cam Pan or Wyze Cam v2, you need to update your camera bootloader to with the latest version using [this guide](https://github.com/gtxaspec/wz_mini_hacks/wiki/Setup-&-Installation) before using the program.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- The program adds the extension `.wz_flash-helper` to its kernel file after it is finished to prevent itself from booting multiple times; therefore you need to rename it back if you want to run the program again.

- The program takes about 15 seconds to load before processing operations.

- T20 releases support: `Wyze Cam Pan` and `Wyze Cam v2`.

- T31 releases support: `Wyze Cam v2 Pan`, `Wyze Cam v3` and `Wyze Cam Floodlight`.
