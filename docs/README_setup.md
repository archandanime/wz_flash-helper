## Setup guide

1. Download [lastest release](https://github.com/archandanime/wz_flash-helper/releases/latest) and extract to your SD card. Depends on your camera SoC, SD card boot image name would be:
- `factory_ZMC6tiIDQN` for T20 cameras
- `factory_t31_ZMC6tiIDQN` for T31 cameras

2. If your camera is running OpenIPC firmware, rename SD card boot image to `factory_0P3N1PC_kernel`

**Note:** If your camera is Pan v2 or v2, follow [this guide](https://github.com/gtxaspec/wz_mini_hacks/wiki/Setup-&-Installation) first
