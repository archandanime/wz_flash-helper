**‚ùó WARNING:**
- DO NOT DISCONNECT POWER when the switch profile operation is going on. This would hard brick your camera.
- Switching to other profiles from OpenIPC is not supported yet. If you have switched to OpenIPC, you need to use SSH or serial connection to switch manually.
- Switching to wzmini profile is not supported yet (it is actually supported but the firmware is still in early development stage)

**Step 1: [Setup](README_setup.md)**

**Step 2: Prepare partition images**

wzmini profile requires four partition images: `boot`, `kernel`, `rootfs` and `configs`.

- `boot` and `configs` partition images can be created by making a copy from Stock firmware backup along with their .sha256sum files.
- `kernel` and `rootfs` partition images along with their .sha256sum files can be downloaded them from (**TBA**).

Example for t31x:

**Step 3: Edit the program configuration file**

Edit `general.conf` with:
```
restore_partitions="no"
switch_profile="yes"
next_profile="wzmini"
```

**Step 4: Power on**

Insert your SD card to the camera and power it on. It would take about 3 minutes to finish writing all partitions, then it will reboot to wzmini firmware.
