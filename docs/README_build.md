### üìñ Overview

wz_flash-helper uses OpenIPC kernel source. The compilation steps are the same as building OpenIPC kernels after the kernel config files are patched.

### ‚Äçüç≥ Prerequisites

A Linux distro with `git`, `fakeroot` and `cpio` packages installed.

Building with WSL2 has not been tested.

### üî® Build

**1. Prepare**

Clone the Github repo:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/archandanime/wz_flash-helper.git
cd wz_flash-helper
```

Patch OpenIPC kernel config:
```
./build.sh patch
```

**2. Build**

To build a kernel, run:
```
./build.sh kernel <SoC>
```

To generate a release, run:
```
./build.sh release <SoC>
```

where as `SoC` is either `t20` or `t31`

To clean up, run:
```
./build.sh clean
```
To build everything, run:
```
./build.sh clean && ./build.sh release t20 && ./build.sh release t31
```

Compiled kernels and releases will be saved at `output/` directory.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- Cloning the Github repo might take up to 15 minutes, depending on your Internet speed.
- On the first time you build a kernel/release, it might take up to 20 minutes to download necessary toolchains before the compiling, after that it takes only about a minute.
